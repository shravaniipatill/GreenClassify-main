🌿 GreenClassify
Deep Learning Web App for Multi-Vegetable Detection & Classification

GreenClassify is an end-to-end Deep Learning powered web application that detects, classifies and counts vegetables from an uploaded image in real-time using a trained CNN model deployed with Flask.

This project was developed as part of the SkillWallet / SmartInternz Deep Learning Internship Program.

🚀 NEW IMPROVEMENTS (Latest Version)

✔ Detects multiple vegetables in a single image
✔ Counts number of vegetables present
✔ Prevents wrong predictions for non-vegetable images
✔ Improved UI and prediction workflow
✔ Clean project structure & GitHub ready

🎯 Project Goal

Build a real-world AI web app that can:

• Automatically identify vegetables from images
• Avoid false predictions for unrelated objects
• Support multi-object detection & counting
• Deploy the trained model as a Flask web app
• Provide a simple and interactive user interface

🧩 Key Features
🥕 Multi-Vegetable Detection

Detects multiple vegetables in one image and returns prediction list.

🔢 Vegetable Counting

Displays how many vegetables are detected.

🚫 Non-Vegetable Rejection

Model avoids random predictions if image is unrelated.

🌐 Web Application

User can upload image and get predictions instantly.

🎨 Modern UI

Responsive, animated and smooth interface.
